## Purpose

*work in progress*

The world is getting weirder at an alarming rate. It is an inescapable conclusion that technology is re-shaping human society on a level more fundamental and dramatic than ever thought possible; and it is accelerating.

Technology is an inert tool, with no inherent morality or regard for human happiness or suffering; a tool that will re-shape all that it touches no matter who wields it.

At the same time, a new generation of humans are entering the world as it is, without knowledge or experience of any other state of affairs. Mainstream culture, tradition, and formal education are inadequate to prepare them for what's to come.

Climate Change. The rise of populist authoritarianism. Surveillance capitalism. Deep fakes. API-driven socioeconomic stratification. The challenges we face are as daunting as they are complex.

We have a responsibility to do what we can to make sure that the most powerful and revolutionary technologies are used to do good, or at least prevented from being used to do evil.

An nowhere is the fulfillment of this responsibility more important than in the developing world.

We must do what we can to ensure that the next generation is better off than the current one.
